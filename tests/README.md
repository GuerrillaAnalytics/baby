### Testing

Strive for 100% code coverage, but don't get obsessed over the coverage score.

#### General testing guidelines

- Use long, descriptive names. This often obviates the need for doctrings in test methods.
- Tests should be isolated. Don't interact with a real database or network. Use a separate test database that gets torn down or use mock objects.
- Prefer [factories](https://github.com/rbarrois/factory_boy) or [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) to fixtures.
- Never let incomplete tests pass, else you run the risk of forgetting about them. Instead, add a placeholder like `assert False, "TODO: finish me"`.
- The argument order of assertEquals is expected, actual. If you use the correct order the error messages will work as intended.

#### Unit Tests

- Focus on one tiny bit of functionality.
- Should be fast, but a slow test is better than no test.
- It often makes sense to have one testcase class for a single class or model.

```python
import unittest
import factories

class PersonTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.person = factories.PersonFactory()

    def test_has_age_in_dog_years(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.person.dog_years, self.person.age / 7)
```

#### Functional Tests

Functional tests are higher level tests that are closer to how an end-user would interact with your application.

- Write tests as scenarios. Testcase and test method names should read like a scenario description.
- Use comments to write out stories, *before writing the test code*.

```python
import unittest

class TestAUser(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_can_write_a_blog_post(self):
        # Goes to the her dashboard
        ...
        # Clicks "New Post"
        ...
        # Fills out the post form
        ...
        # Clicks "Submit"
        ...
        # Can see the new post
        ...
```

Notice how the testcase and test method read together like "Test A User can write a blog post".
